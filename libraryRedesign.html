        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>With over 900,000 active borrowers, the QueensLibrary has made a place
        for itself in the communities that it serves - offering numerous
        community and arts events, career training, and translation services
        alongside its more traditional services of lending books and
        facilitating research. QueensLibrary's website, however, makes
        learning about these events and services rather difficult
        and could be much improved in terms of user experience. Since
        the website plays a vital role in promoting QueensLibrary and
        its services, I decided to do a redesign of the website with a
        focus on improving usability and visual appearance.<br><br>

        *<u>2020 Note</u>: This study was done in late 2018, so is about the version
        of the library's website up at the time. It looks like the library
        has revamped their website since then!

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <div class="writing">
        <p>To start, I took an in-depth look at the existing
          QueensLibrary website, taking note of areas that could
          be improved upon. These areas fell into three main categories affecting user experience:
          intuitive design, ease of learning, and efficiency.
          <br><br></p>
        <p>
          <b>Intuitive Design:</b> <br><br>
          As is, the navigation is very spread out, making it difficult for users
              to determine where they can find the services they need. The homepage
              has three separate sections for navigation – one at the top by the logo,
              one in the middle with brightly colored drop-down menus, and one at the
              bottom. As can be seen from the links and header examples below, the
              sections also overlap in terms of topic and functionality
              (such as accessing pages for kids programs). <br><br>

        <img id="library-homepage-2" src="imgs/redesign/queensLibraryBottom2.png" alt="original home page">
        <br><br>
        <p>
          <b>Ease of Learning:</b><br><br>
          One potential difficulty for a new user lies in the search
          functionality, since to figure out if a library has a certain book,
          a new user has to perform a search using the search bar on the upper
          right hand corner. On many websites, however, a search bar in that
          location performs a search over all of the pages on the site, so a
          new users looking to search over only the library’s catalog may
          overlook this feature.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Efficiency:</b> <br><br>
          Finding hours and locations: Currently, the user has to first
          find the link to the hours and locations page on one of the
          navigation areas, and then has to scroll through a long list
          of all potential hours to find the library that they are looking for.
          <br><br>
          Searching: Filtering after performing a search currently requires
          clicking on links consecutively to narrow down one feature
          (languages, years, types, etc.) at a time. For example, filtering
          by language and type would require two page reloads. In addition,
          the filter options are all listed on a right sidebar, so a user
          would have to scroll down a lot to get to what they want to
          filter by.<br><br>

      <h2>Usability Design</h2>
      <div class="writing">
        <p>The next step was redesigning the website
          based on usability guidelines. I focused on the following pages: homepage,
          catalog search page, book information page, user account page,
          and kids page, since these five pages together captured
          a variety of the features and services offered. Using Balsamiq, I tested layouts
          and ways of consolidating the library's information to improve
          user experience. Here's a breakdown of the changes:</p><br>
        <p>
          <b>Intuitive Design / Navigation:</b><br><br>
          To make navigation more intuitive, I kept navigation to two
          areas, each targeting a different use case: a nav bar
          across the top focusing on the library as most people
          know it – a source of information and a resource for learning – and
          a group of links in the footer focusing on the library as an organization. These
          use cases don't often overlap, so the focus-based
          separation allows users to stick to a single method of navigation
          throughout the entire site, rather than having to move and
          search for what they need across navigation areas and
          links. Users now have a distinct starting point
          when searching for a particular page or piece of information. Fewer
          navigation sections also limit potential content overlaps.</p><br>
        <p>
          <b>Learnability:</b><br><br>
          To improve learnability for new users, I divided the current
          search feature into two. The search bar
          at the top right of the page searches through website
          content, while the search in the navigation bar searches through
          the library's catalog. Both are given placeholders, 'search
          website' vs 'search catalog', to make their functionality clear
          to the user.</p><br>
        <p>
          <b>Efficiency:</b><br><br>
          To improve efficiency, I focused my changes on the following
          common website use cases:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Filtering after performing a search: Rather than having all of the
            options for the filters being presented as links as was originally the case,
            I decided to present the options for each filter in drop down menus.
            This conserves space, and allows the user to quickly look through all of
            the available filter categories (location, language, etc). I also decided
            to place all of the results in their own scrollable window within the page
            rather than having the entire page scroll, since this would allow users to
            be able to quickly reach the filter functionality regardless of where they
            are in the search results. Leaving the page scrollable and stickying the
            filter section so that it moves down with the page
            would work as well.</li><br>
          <li>Looking for a library's hours: Since this is a very common use case for
            the website, I decided to make a separate section for hours at the top of
            the website.</li><br>
          <li>Checking account details: Checking account information
            is a frequently used feature (particularly after reserving a book
            online), so I decided to include a small snapshot of account information
            on the top right of every page. Once logged in, the area will show account
            details, allowing users to quickly verify that their book requests have gone
            through without having to leave the book information or search page to visit
            the account page.</li>
        </ul><br><br>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Visual Design</h2>
      <div class="writing">
        <p>With navigation and general usability figured out, the
          next step was to redesign the website with a focus on visual
          appearance. I built the high-fidelity mockups using Proto.io.
          <br><br>
          To improve alignment, the redesigned site is based on a six-column
          vertical grid. Six columns is small enough to provide structure,
          while still large enough to accommodate different sections and groupings.
          I modified the color palette of the website to include orange
          and blue, with the aim of making the site a little more lively, inviting, and
          engaging. Orange was chosen as the main color to match the
          library’s logo, and blue as the accent color since to balance
          out the orange. To further improve navigation and
          to help a user find what they need more quickly, I used blue to draw
          attention to important areas like sitewide notices, the search catalog
          link, and headings.</p><br><br>
