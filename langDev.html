        <h2>Context</h2>
        <!--<h3>Problem:</h3>-->
        <p>Currently, there are many language learning websites out there,
        but very few that allow users to choose and build their own vocabulary.
        Of the few that do, none - to our knowledge - allow users to customize
        their vocabulary list without having to input a preexisting data set of
        already translated words. Wouldn't it be much simpler and less tedious
        if an web app + extension could simultaneously assist in building a
        personalized vocabulary set and help with language learning?</p><br>
        <!--<h3>Solution:</h3>-->
        <p>LangDev tackles this problem in two parts. First, LangDev's
        Chrome browser extension allows users to build their vocabulary
        set as painlessly as possible. When a user comes across an unknown
        word in a foreign language while browsing the internet, they can
        highlight the word and press a keyboard shortcut to bring up a
        list of definitions for the word. If they feel that this is a
        word that they would like to learn and remember, they can simply
        press the add button next to the definition. The word is then saved
        to the user's personal vocabulary list.</p><br>
        <p>Second, given this personalized vocabulary set, LangDev's
        corresponding web application will motivate and assist the user in
        learning through various learning techniques. The Leitner system,
        which implements spaced repetition, is used to sort the vocabulary
        into groups to present to the user for review at various intervals.
        Besides flashcard review, there are also progress trackers,
        achievements, and language learning games utilizing the personalized
        vocabulary to aid users in their language learning journey.

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <div class="writing">
        <p>First, we started off by designing a user flow diagram to clarify
        how all of LangDev's components (the extension and the individual
        web app pages) fit together, and iterated through them to simplify
        navigation and ease of learning for the user.</p><br>

        <img src="imgs/langDev/langDevFlow.gif" alt="langdev flow">
        <p>Note: The gif reflects some of the wireframes and more detailed
        mockups that we later built on top of that diagram for clarification
        purposes.</p><br>
        <p>We then mapped out the majority of the key interactions between the
        frontend and the backend for all of the major components of the web
        application and extension, noting the data that needs to be stored
        and retrieved for various pages and situations. This allowed us to
        efficiently work in our individual roles while maintaining the
        consistency needed for easier integration at a later date.</p>

        <div class="img-block">
          <div class="caption">
            <p>Once logged in, the homepage of the web app features a

            <p>To help build a sense of community on the site,

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <div class="writing conclusion">
        <p>
        There were so many lessons learned from this project, but
        to summarize a few key takeaways:
        </p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Although integration was not as difficult as we had originally
           thought it might be (likely because we took precautions, as described
           in the process above), it still took quite a bit of time, and we had
           our fair share of Github merge conflicts. So, one of my lessons
           learned is to start integration early and to integrate each part of
           the project as soon as they are stable. Once we started following
           that strategy, (though we couldn't avoid merge conflicts altogether)
           our merge conflicts became much easier to resolve, since all of our
           copies of the code weren't radically different from each others.</li><br>
	        <li>We don't always have time to accomplish all of the cool features
           that we want to include, and that often turns out to be totally okay.
           Towards the end of the project, we made the decision to focus on
           solidifying and fully testing our core functionality rather than
           implementing additional features, and that allowed us to feel
           confident in our final product rather than crunched for time.</li><br>
	        <li>Working in different roles / on different parts of the project,
           but still being in the same room (advice that we'd received from our
           professor and took to heart) works incredibly well in terms of
           building productivity, since we were able to easily and quickly
           discuss functionalities and interactions between our individual
           parts of the project. It also boosted morale during those tricky
           debugging sessions and made the development process that much more
           enjoyable.</li><br>
