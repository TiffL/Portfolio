      <p>ePubbly is a browser-based ePub viewer. It was built with the aim of
        giving people (especially Windows users) the option of viewing
        their .epub files online without having to download additional software.</p>

      <h2>Context</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="writing">
      <p>Earlier in May, a friend was looking for recommendations
        for online ePub readers, since Microsoft Edge had stopped
        their support for .epub. A quick online search revealed
        that although there are existing options for ePub readers,
        most are either in the form of browser extensions or
        downloadable software. This isn't ideal for several groups
        of users, including those looking to read their .epubs
        accross multiple devices (as it would require redownloading a copy of the
        extension or software for each device), and those with limited
        device space. Of the few in-browser options found, none seemed to
        offer the customizability and assessibility (dark mode,
        larger font) of existing downloadable options. <br><br>

        As a result, I decided to build one. My goal for this project,
        then, was to create a web app
        that allows users to view their .epub files in the browser, with the process
        as streamlined and simple as possible. </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="writing">
      <p><br>In keeping with the site's "no hassle" tagline, I went with a
      minimalistic look and feel for the site. Keeping both the navigation
      and appearance simple will help minimize distractions, hopefully improving the
      experience for most users whose goal is to focus
      on their book or document.<br><br>
      To achieve a relaxed feel, the color palette consists of more muted colors.
      The project's title is ePubbly (think "bubbly"), though, so to keep the
      mood rather joyful as well, I went with colors on the lighter end of
      the spectrum - a warm beige primary color with a brighter blue accent.<br><br>

          <p>Users are greeted by a
            landing page with a single button to choose a file.
            Only .epub files are accepted, and the file navigator greys out
            non-epub files, making it easier for
            users to locate the files they need.</p>

          <p>The reading view keeps tools
            accessible at the top of the screen, but with decreased contrast to
            avoid competing with the document for the user's attention.<br><br>
            These tools include a clickable table of contents for quick navigation
            through the file, as well as customizability options.</p>
