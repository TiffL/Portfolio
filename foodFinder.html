      <h1>NYC Food Finder</h1>
      <p>NYC Food Finder is a web app that helps people discover fun and interesting food options and experiences in the city. It was created as part of a UI/UX class project exploring the use of live filtering in improving user experience.</p>

      <h2>Context</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="writing">
      <p>For this project, my goal was to create a web application that allows a user to look for, filter, and sort through some of the fun desserts and dishes that can be found in NYC, using React to improve user experience by allowing for live filtering and speedy interface changes in response to user actions. The application will hopefully be valuable to users looking to discover new, quirky food experiences in the city. </p>

      <p>The application incorporates several user interface design principles. For the layout, it uses a grid for a cleaner appearance, and the most important information (the search bar and filters) is placed on the top left of the page, allowing them to be visible regardless of screen size. I made use of center part alignment in the info below the images to improve readability, since the categories vary in terms of length, and chose a minty green color for a more relaxed but still food-related appearance. </p>
