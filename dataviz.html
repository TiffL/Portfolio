        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>The goal for this project was to design a dashboard that effectively visualizes
        video game sales data to meet the needs of a potential audience looking to perform
        exploratory analysis. In order to be effective, it needed to accomplish the
        following: have an easily understandable and navigatable interface, clearly
        communicate potential trends or patterns (or lack therof) to follow up on, and
        efficiently display the large amount of data and information in a smaller and more
        compact visual space.</p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <div class="writing">
        <!--<h3 class="pb-10">The Questions</h3>-->
        <p>Although the data is of interest to many different audiences,
          this dashboard views the data from the perspective of
          a game developer looking to create a new product. The intended
          audience, then, may be looking to answer the following questions as
          part of their exploratory analysis: <br><br></p>
        <ul>
          <li class="pb-4">Which games have had the most sales? This could be a gateway
            into further research on why these top-selling games peformed so well.</li>
          <li class="pb-4">Who are the competitors in their intended genre? Who are the
            major players?</li>
          <li>How popular is their intended genre in a particular region?</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Dataset</h2>
      <div class="writing">
        <!--<h3 class="pb-10">The Dataset</h3>-->
        <p>The Kaggle dataset contains the following fields:
          video game name, ranking, year published, genre,
          publisher, and sales. Sales data includes both total
          global sales and sales broken up into
          regional categories - North America, Europe, Japan, and Other.
          This isn't ideal, since the regional groupings are of differing
          levels of specificity (continents vs. countries vs. everywhere
          else), making it difficult to do comparisons between regions. Due
          to time constraints, I used the categories as is for this project,
          but an extension of this project could benefit from sourcing
          additional data from other places.</p>

      <div class="writing">
        <!--<h3 class="pb-10">The Graphs</h3>-->
        <p>The next step was to put together the questions and the dataset.
          Each section of the dashboard addresses one of the questions above.</p><br>

            <p class="pb-10"><b>Section 1: Which games have had the most sales?</b></p>
            <p>This section shows the top 10 best-selling video games of
               all time, as well as for each individual release year. Rank is
               determined by the video game's total global sales.</p>

            <p class="pb-10"><b>Section 2: Who are the competitors in
               their intended genre? Who are the major players?</b></p>
            <p class="pb-10">This section consists of two views: a rankings
              and a stats view. The rankings view displays the 20
              best selling publishers for each genre, providing insight
              as to who the major players are in each.</p>
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that these major players
              tend to be extreme outliers in terms of total sales when
              compared to the average total sales in their genre, however.
              As a result, developers may prefer to use
              the stats view instead to get a better sense of what
              the average company can expect to earn in terms of global sales
              and to identify similarly positioned developers that are more
              likely to be competitors.</p>

            <p class="pb-10">Both individual data points and box plots are shown. Here the
              focus is on the box plots. The lower right toggle, however, gives the
              option of focusing on the points instead. Jitter is included to limit overlaps and to give a better
              sense of the data's distribution.</p>
            <p class="pb-10">Tooltips are also included to provide a more detailed look
              at the data. Hovering over a point reveals the publisher's
              name and sales, while hovering over a plot brings up
              statistics for the genre's publisher total sales.</p>

              aggregated for each region in the dataset -
              North America, Europe, Japan, and "Other". The map provides a
              quick overview of results, displaying the best-selling genre
              for each region. </p>
            <p>Several GeoJSON objects (one for each of the dataset's regions)
              were combined to provide interactivity for additional detail.
              Hovering over each region updates a pie chart
              breaking down the region's genre sales, allowing developers to
              gauge their intended genre's relative share of the region's market.</p>
